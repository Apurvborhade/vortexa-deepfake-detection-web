# Deepfake Detector

A web-based Deepfake Detection system that identifies whether an image or video is real or manipulated using state-of-the-art deep learning models. The system includes heatmap visualization to highlight areas that influenced the model's decision.

---

## Features

- **Image and Video Detection** – Upload images or videos to detect authenticity.  
- **Heatmap Visualization** – Visual explanations of model decisions using Grad-CAM.  
- **API Integration** – REST API for easy integration into web applications.  
- **Real-time Feedback** – Immediate results for uploaded content.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Express.js  
- **Deep Learning**: PyTorch, Transformers  
- **Frontend**: React.js / Next.js  
- **Visualization**: OpenCV, Matplotlib  
- **Others**: Multer (for file uploads), Sharp (for image processing), JWT authentication (optional)

If you want, I can **also make a more concise, hackathon-friendly version** that highlights features and MVP impact—it’ll make your repo look polished and ready for submission.  

Do you want me to do that?
